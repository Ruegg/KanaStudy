# KanaStudy

KanaStudy is a website built in ReactJS that currently utilizes three methods of memorization and matching to help enforce the Japanese writing systems, Hiragana and Katakana.

The first two methods consist of typing in the shown characters, or selecting the corresponding kana. The third method is essentially a revamped typing speed test, but the catch is you'll be reading kana and typing in romaji. With this method, it's very clear to see one's progression in reading and writing.

The website can be accessed from both [studykana.com](https://studykana.com) or [kana.study](https://kana.study)
